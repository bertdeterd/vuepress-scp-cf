# Introduction

With the introduction of the SAP Cloud Platform - Cloud Foundry environment (SCP-CF) we now have the ability to deploy node.js apps. For creating a SCP-CF app there is quite a lot of configuration needed. However with the use of vue.js and the Vue-CLI we have the tools to rapidly setup an SCP-CF app so you can start developing your SAP app in just a few steps.<br>
